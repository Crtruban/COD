Drip. Drip. That hollow sound pierces the silence in this cave
          as water slowly falls from stalactites. Stale air fills your lungs as
          you take in the cave. A large, unworked stone column holds up the
          ceiling. Stout stairs leading up hug the column’s one side while a
          5-foot high ledge that leads into darkness appears along the other.
          Further back, a second set of stairs leads up to a stone door carved

            detect magic spell reveals the door radiates an aura of necromancy
            magic. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the
            trap for what it is and reveals how to disable it. The trap is
            triggered when a creature that is not undead touches the door, an
            attempt to pick the door’s lock fails, or the door is attacked. The
            skull’s eyes emit a line of necrotic energy that is 15 feet long and
            5 feet wide that shoots down the stairs. Each creature in the line
            must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level
            of exhaustion. Creatures that fail this saving throw by 5 or more
            gain two levels of exhaustion. Scratching out both the skull’s eyes
            with a weapon or tool disables the trap.</li></ul>`,1),T=l(`<h5 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Dungeon Flow</h5> <ul><li>Going to the north with lead the players to the dungeon</li> <li>Going south west will lead players to the glittering cavern.
