            the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit
            points from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an
            infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a
            failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a
            successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one
            level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s
